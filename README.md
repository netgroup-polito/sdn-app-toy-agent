# SND Application ToY Agent

This repository keeps the ToY Agent module that allows reading and writing state of SDN applications from higher level services.

The ToY Agent module (former State Listener) can be included into an existing application (just copying the StateListener folder and call it from the main class). An example can be found into the "use cases" folder.
